Here are the steps/requirements for building 'ansible' from source code on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system:\n\n1. Install the necessary tools for building software from source. This includes compilers (C, C++), build tools like autotools and make, software libraries, and any other dependencies specific to 'ansible'.\n\n2. Download the source code for 'ansible'. This can be done by downloading a tarball from the 'ansible' website.\n\n3. Compile the 'ansible' code using the tools installed in step 1.\n\n4. Install the compiled 'ansible' software onto your system.\n\n5. Add any necessary startup scripts for 'ansible'.\n\nThese steps should help you build 'ansible' from source on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system. Make sure to follow any specific instructions provided by the 'ansible' project as well."

Clone the Ansible git repository:\n   $ git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git --recursive\n   $ cd ./ansible\n\n2. Setup the Ansible environment:\n   - Using Bash:\n     $ source ./hacking/env-setup\n   - Using Fish:\n     $ source ./hacking/env-setup.fish\n   - To suppress spurious warnings/errors:\n     $ source ./hacking/env-setup -q\n\n3. Install pip if not already installed:\n   $ sudo easy_install pip\n\n4. Install required Python modules:\n   $ sudo pip install -r ./requirements.txt\n\n5. Update Ansible checkouts:\n   - Update source tree and submodules for versions v2.2 and older:\n     $ git pull --rebase\n     $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n\n6. Specify an inventory file (optional):\n   - Create a custom inventory file:\n     $ echo \"127.0.0.1\" > ~/ansible_hosts\n   - Export the inventory file path:\n     $ export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=~/ansible_hosts\n\n7. Test the installation by running a ping command:\n   $ ansible all -m ping\n\nPlease note that the above steps assume that you have Python 2 (version 2.7) or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed on your system as per the Ansible documentation. Additional requirements may vary based on the specific use case and modules/plugins being used."
