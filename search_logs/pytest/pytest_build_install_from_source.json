Run the following command in the command line to install pytest:\n   $ pip install -U pytest\n\n3. Check that the correct version of pytest is installed:\n   $ pytest --version\n   Output should indicate the version you installed, for example pytest 8.3.3\n\n4. Instructions for creating your first test:\n   - Create a new file called test_sample.py containing a function and a test code.\n   - Example code:\n     # content of test_sample.py\n     def func(x):\n         return x + 1\n     def test_answer():\n         assert func(3) == 5\n   - Run the test using pytest: $ pytest\n\n5. Additional test execution options:\n   - Run all test files in the current directory and subdirectories: pytest\n   - Assert a specific exception is raised: Use the raises helper\n   - Quiet reporting mode for test execution: $ pytest -q test_filename.py\n\n6. Grouping tests in a class:\n   - Create a class containing multiple tests.\n   - Example code:\n     # content of test_class.py\n     class TestClass:\n         def test_one(self):\n             x = \"this\"\n             assert \"h\" in x\n         def test_two(self):\n             x = \"hello\"\n             assert hasattr(x, \"check\")\n   - Run the module by passing its filename: $ pytest -q test_class.py\n\n7. Requesting a unique temporary directory for functional tests:\n   - Use pytest's built-in fixtures/function arguments to request resources.\n   - Example code:\n     # content of test_tmp_path.py\n     def test_needsfiles(tmp_path):\n         print(tmp_path)\n         assert 0\n   - Run the test to create a unique temporary directory: $ pytest -q test_tmp_path.py\n\nNote: The webpage does not provide detailed step-by-step installation instructions for building pytest from source code on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system. It only provides information on installing pytest using pip and running basic tests."

Here are the steps for manually building pytest-dependency from the source distribution on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system:\n\n**System Requirements:**\n- Python 3.4 or newer.\n- setuptools.\n- pytest 3.7.0 or newer.\n\n**Optional Library Packages:**\n- git-props (only needed for building from the development source tree).\n- distutils-pytest >= 0.2 (only needed to run the test suite).\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n1. Download the sources from the Release Page on GitHub (pytest-dependency-X.X.tar.gz).\n2. Check the signature of the downloaded file (optional).\n   `$ gpg --verify pytest-dependency-X.X.tar.gz.asc`\n3. Unpack the downloaded file and change into the source directory.\n4. Build the project (optional):\n   `$ python setup.py build`\n5. Test the project (optional):\n   `$ python setup.py test`\n6. Install the project:\n   `$ python setup.py install`\n\nIf you prefer a shorter installation method, you can also use pip to install pytest-dependency:\n   `$ pip install pytest-dependency`\n\nNote: The webpage does not provide specific instructions for the installation of pytest itself, as pytest-dependency is an extension of pytest. You should ensure that pytest is already installed on your system before installing pytest-dependency."
