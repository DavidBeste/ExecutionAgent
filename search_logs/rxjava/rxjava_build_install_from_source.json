Ensure you have Java 6 or later installed on your system.\n2. Clone the RxJava source code repository by running the following command:\n   ```\n   $ git clone git@github.com:ReactiveX/RxJava.git\n   ```\n3. Change into the RxJava directory by running:\n   ```\n   $ cd RxJava/\n   ```\n4. To build the project, use Gradle by running the command:\n   ```\n   $ ./gradlew build\n   ```\n5. To perform a clean build, use:\n   ```\n   $ ./gradlew clean build\n   ```\n6. After a successful build, you should see the unit tests run, similar to:\n   ```\n   > Building\n   > :rxjava:test\n   > 91 tests completed\n   ```\n7. Troubleshooting steps are also provided if you encounter errors during the build process, such as resolving dependencies or JVM issues.\n\nPlease note that the page does not provide specific commands for installing any required dependencies on a Debian/Ubuntu system."
