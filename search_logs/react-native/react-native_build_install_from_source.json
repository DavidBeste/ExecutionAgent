Here is a structured list of steps/requirements for installing or building the project 'react-native' on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system:\n\n1. **Android Prerequisites**:\n   - Make sure you have the Android SDK installed.\n   - Ensure you have the following installed:\n     - Android SDK version 29.\n     - SDK build tools version 29.0.2.\n     - Android Support Repository >= 29.\n     - Android NDK 20b.\n\n2. **Setting Environment Variables**:\n   - Set environment variables for Android SDK and Android NDK in your local shell.\n   - Example:\n     ```bash\n     export ANDROID_SDK=/Users/your_unix_name/android-sdk-macosx \n     export ANDROID_NDK=/Users/your_unix_name/android-ndk/android-ndk-r20b\n     ```\n\n3. **Creating local.properties file**:\n   - Create a local.properties file in the android directory of your react-native app with the SDK and NDK directory paths.\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     sdk.dir=/Users/your_unix_name/android-sdk-macosx \n     ndk.dir=/Users/your_unix_name/android-ndk/android-ndk-r20b\n     ```\n\n4. **Downloading Android NDK**:\n   - Download Android NDK from the provided links based on your operating system.\n\n5. **Building the source**:\n   - Install React Native from your fork using `npm install --save github:facebook/react-native#master`.\n   - Add gradle dependencies and ReactAndroid project as mentioned in the instructions.\n\n6. **Building from Android Studio**:\n   - Import the project in Android Studio using the android folder of your app.\n\n7. **Additional notes**:\n   - Building from source may take a long time, especially for the first build.\n   - Update react-native version from your repo carefully to avoid re-downloading files.\n   - Troubleshoot any build issues that may arise during the process.\n\nThese are the instructions relevant to installing or building the project 'react-native' on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system from the provided webpage."

Here are the list of steps/requirements in a structured way:\n\n1. Installing Node & Watchman:\n- Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew: \nbrew install node \nbrew install watchman \n- Make sure Node is version 18.18 or newer\n\n2. Installing Java Development Kit (JDK):\n- Recommend installing the OpenJDK distribution called Azul Zulu using Homebrew\n- Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew: \nbrew install --cask zulu@17 \nbrew info --cask zulu@17 \n- After the JDK installation, add or update your JAVA_HOME environment variable\n- JDK will likely be located at /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home\n\n3. Android development environment setup:\n- Download and install Android Studio\n- Install the Android SDK with Android 14 (UpsideDownCake) SDK\n- Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable\n- Add the following lines to your ~/.zprofile or ~/.zshrc config file\n\n4. Preparing the Android device:\n- Use a physical Android device or Android Virtual Device (AVD) for development\n\n5. Additional steps:\n- Follow additional configuration steps as outlined on the web page\n\nThe commands that need to be installed are:\n- brew install node\n- brew install watchman\n- brew install --cask zulu@17\n\nNote: The webpage also contains instructions for setting up the Android development environment, which may be relevant if building the React Native app for Android on Debian/Ubuntu Linux."
