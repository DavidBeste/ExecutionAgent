Clone the XGBoost repository from GitHub:\n   ```\n   git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost\n   cd xgboost\n   ```\n\n2. Install the necessary build dependencies:\n   For Ubuntu/Debian systems, run:\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get install -y cmake make gcc g++\n   ```\n\n3. Build the package using cmake and make:\n   ```\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n   cmake ..\n   make -j4\n   ```\n\n4. Install the built package using pip:\n   ```\n   cd ..\n   cd python-package\n   pip install -e .\n   ```\n\nTo update an existing installation that was built from source, simply pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository and rebuild the package:\n   ```\n   git pull\n   cd build\n   make clean\n   make -j4\n   pip install -e .\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can customize the build configuration of XGBoost and optimize it for your specific needs on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system."

Clone the XGBoost repository with Git submodules by running the following command:\n   git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost\n\n2. Change into the xgboost directory:\n   cd xgboost\n\n3. Create a build directory:\n   mkdir build\n\n4. Change into the build directory:\n   cd build\n\n5. Run CMake to configure the build:\n   cmake ..\n\n6. Build XGBoost using make with parallel jobs:\n   make -j $(nproc)\n\n7. For Python package installation, the Python package is located in python-package/ directory. You can install the package using Python setuptools commands like:\n   - python setup.py install\n   - python setup.py build\n   - python setup.py sdist\n   - python setup.py bdist\n   - python setup.py bdist_wheel\n   You can pass additional compilation options like CUDA acceleration and NCCL support using flags.\n\n8. You can install the created distribution packages using pip with a command like:\n   pip install ./xgboost-1.0.0.tar.gz\n\n9. For Windows users, XGBoost can be built with MinGW-w64 by following specific guidelines provided on the webpage.\n\n10. For R Package Installation, you can install XGBoost from CRAN using the command:\n    install.packages(\"xgboost\")\n\nThese are the steps and requirements to build and install XGBoost from source on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system."
