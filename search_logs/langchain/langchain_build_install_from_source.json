Here is a structured list of steps to follow along with the commands that need to be installed:\n\n1. Clone the LangChain repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain.git\n   ```\n\n2. Install the LangChain library:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e langchain/libs/langchain\n   ```\n\n3. Ensure poetry is installed. If not, install it using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install poetry\n   ```\n\n4. Navigate to the directory containing the pyproject.toml file:\n   ```bash\n   cd langchain/libs/community\n   ```\n\n5. Use poetry to build the package:\n   ```bash\n   poetry build\n   ```\n\nThese steps will create a distribution package in the dist directory in the form of a .tar.gz file and a .whl file. Note that the langchain_community package contains tools in subdirectories under langchain_community/tools. Each tool is represented by a Python module."
