Install Git:\n   - Command: sudo apt-get install git\n\n2. Clone the RxJava repository:\n   - Command: git clone git@github.com:Netflix/RxJava.git\n\n3. Change directory to the RxJava project:\n   - Command: cd RxJava/\n\n4. Build the project using Gradle:\n   - Command: ./gradlew build\n\n5. For a clean build, use the following command:\n   - Command: ./gradlew clean build\n\n6. The build process should include compilation, processing resources, testing, and packaging of the project.\n\nThese steps outline the process of building the RxJava project from the source code on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system."
