Here are the structured steps and requirements:\n\n1. Prerequisites:\n- gcc, clang, or another C compiler\n- cmake version 2.8 or higher (recommended version 3.16 or higher)\n- doxygen version 1.8.13 or higher (optional)\n- valgrind (optional)\n\n2. Build instructions:\n- Clone the json-c GitHub repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/json-c/json-c.git`\n- Create a build directory: `$ mkdir json-c-build`\n- Navigate to the build directory: `$ cd json-c-build`\n- Generate build files using cmake: `$ cmake ../json-c`\n- Compile the project: `$ make`\n- Run tests: `$ make test`\n- Optionally skip using valgrind for tests: `$ make USE_VALGRIND=0 test`\n- Install the project (may require sudo): `$ sudo make install`\n\n3. Generating documentation with Doxygen:\n- Run the following commands in the build directory:\n```\nmake doc\ngoogle-chrome doc/html/index.html\n```\n\n4. CMake Options:\n- Various options can be passed to cmake to configure the build, such as CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, BUILD_STATIC_LIBS, etc.\n\n5. Building with partial threading support:\n- Enable threading support using the cmake option: `-DENABLE_THREADING=ON`\n\n6. Testing:\n- To disable valgrind for tests: `export USE_VALGRIND=0`\n- Separate build directory recommended for testing\n\n7. Building on Unix and Windows with vcpkg:\n- Instructions for downloading and installing json-c using vcpkg\n\n8. Building for Android:\n- Instructions for building json-c on Android platforms using cmake\n\n9. Linking to `libjson-c`:\n- Instructions for linking json-c library in makefiles, cmake, and without pkgconfig\n\n10. Using `json-c`:\n- Include necessary header files like json_object.h, json_tokener.h, json_pointer.h, json_object_iterator.h, json_visit.h, json_util.h to use json-c functionalities.\n\nIn summary:\n- Clone source code, create a build directory, configure with cmake, build the project, run tests, install the project, generate documentation, use cmake options as needed, consider threading support, test with or without valgrind, link the library, and utilize json-c functionalities as needed."
