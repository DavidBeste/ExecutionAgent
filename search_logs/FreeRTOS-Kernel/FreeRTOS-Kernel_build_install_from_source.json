Here is a structured list of steps and requirements:\n\n1. Clone the FreeRTOS repository including submodules:\n   ```\n   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS ./FreeRTOS\n   ```\n\n2. Navigate to the FreeRTOS directory:\n   ```\n   cd FreeRTOS\n   ```\n\n3. Execute the make command to build the project:\n   ```\n   make\n   ```\n\n4. The above steps should generate an executable for you to run the FreeRTOS demo.\n\nThe webpage does not explicitly mention any specific commands that need to be installed on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system to build the project. It recommends using the make command to build the project, which is typically included in Linux distributions."
