Below are the structured steps for each:\n\n**Installing Deno Release Binary:**\n1. Run the following commands on Unix-based systems:\n```\ncurl -L https://deno.land/x/install/install.py | python\nexport PATH=$HOME/.deno/bin:$PATH\n```\n2. On Windows, install through Powershell using:\n```\niex (iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1)\n```\n\n**Compiling Deno From Source:**\n1. Clone the Deno repository and fetch dependencies:\n```\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/denoland/deno.git\ncd deno\n./tools/setup.py\n```\n2. Build Deno using:\n```\n./tools/build.py\n```\n3. Additionally, for a release build, set DENO_BUILD_MODE to release before building:\n```\nDENO_BUILD_MODE=release ./tools/build.py\n```\n4. The built files will be located at target/debug/ for debug builds and target/release/ for release builds.\n\n5. Deno also supports Cargo build, which can be done by running:\n```\ncargo build\n```\n\nThe webpage does provide information on how to install or build the project 'Deno' on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system, both from the release binary and from source code."

Clone the Repository:\n   - Run the command: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/denoland/deno.git\n\n2. Prerequisites:\n   - Update or Install Rust by following the instructions in the rust-toolchain.toml file.\n   - Check that Rust installed correctly by running: \n     rustc -V \n     cargo -V\n\n3. Native Compilers and Linkers:\n   - For Linux(Debian)/WSL:\n     - Run the commands:\n       wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh\n       chmod +x llvm.sh\n       ./llvm.sh 17\n       apt install --install-recommends -y cmake libglib2.0-dev\n\n   - For Mac:\n     - Ensure XCode Command Line Tools is installed.\n     - Install CMake by running: brew install cmake\n\n   - For Mac M1/M2:\n     - Install lld by running: brew install llvm lld\n     - Add /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/ to $PATH\n\n   - For Windows:\n     - Install Visual Studio Community 2019 with the necessary components for C++ development.\n\n4. Protobuf Compiler:\n   - For Linux(Debian)/WSL:\n     - Run the command: apt install -y protobuf-compiler\n     - Check the compiler version with: protoc --version\n\n   - For Mac:\n     - Run the command: brew install protobuf\n     - Check the compiler version with: protoc --version\n\n   - For Windows:\n     - Download the latest binary release from GitHub\n\n5. Python 3:\n   - Ensure Python 3 is installed and accessible in the PATH without a suffix.\n\n6. Building Deno:\n   - To build Deno with a precompiled version of V8, run: cargo build -vv\n   - To build Deno and V8 from source code, run: V8_FROM_SOURCE=1 cargo build -vv\n\n7. Building:\n   - Build with Cargo by running:\n     - Build: cargo build -vv\n     - If there are build errors, try: cargo clean && cargo build -vv\n     - Run: ./target/debug/deno run tests/testdata/run/002_hello.ts\n\n8. Running Tests:\n   - Run Rust tests during the build process: cargo test -vv\n   - Run TypeScript tests using: \n     - Run all unit/tests: target/debug/deno test -A --unstable --lock=tools/deno.lock.json --config tests/config/deno.json tests/unit\n     - Run a specific test: target/debug/deno test -A --unstable --lock=tools/deno.lock.json --config tests/config/deno.json tests/unit/os_test.ts\n\n9. Working with Multiple Crates:\n   - If working with multiple Deno crates, use Cargo's patch feature.\n   - Example: cargo build --config 'patch.crates-io.deno_ast.path=\"../deno_ast\"'\n   - Add the patch to your Cargo.toml file if needed. Ensure dependencies versions match."
