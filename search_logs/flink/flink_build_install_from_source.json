Install Maven and JDK:\n   - Install Maven 3.8.6 and a JDK (Java Development Kit). Flink requires Java 8 (deprecated) or Java 11 to build.\n\n2. Clone the Flink repository:\n   - Clone the Flink git repository using the command:\n     ```\n     git clone https://github.com/apache/flink.git\n     ```\n\n3. Build Flink:\n   - Navigate to the Flink source code directory and run the following command:\n     ```\n     mvn clean install -DskipTests\n     ```\n\n4. Speed up the build (optional):\n   - To speed up the build process, you can use additional options and profiles. \n   - Example:\n     ```\n     mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dfast -Pskip-webui-build -T 1C\n     ```\n\n5. Install C compiler (optional) on Linux:\n   - If you want to build PyFlink with Cython extension support, you need to install a C compiler on Linux. Use the following command:\n     ```\n     sudo apt-get install build-essential\n     ```\n\n6. Build and install PyFlink (optional):\n   - Navigate to the Flink source code directory and run the following commands:\n     ```\n     cd flink-python\n     python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n     cd apache-flink-libraries\n     python setup.py sdist\n     cd ..\n     python -m pip install apache-flink-libraries/dist/*.tar.gz\n     ```\n\n7. Build against a specific Scala version (optional):\n   - If you use Scala APIs and libraries, you may need to specify a Scala version. Use the following command format:\n     ```\n     mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dscala.version=<scala version>\n     ```\n\nNote: The webpage does not provide instructions for installing dependencies like Maven and JDK on Debian/Ubuntu specifically."

        "analysis": "The webpage provides instructions for building Apache Flink from the source code on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system. Below are the steps and requirements for building Flink:\n\n1. Prerequisites for building Flink:\n   - Unix-like environment (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)\n   - Git\n   - Maven version 3.8.6\n   - Java 8 or 11 (Java 9 or 10 may work)\n\n2. Commands to install the required tools:\n   - `sudo apt-get install git`\n   - Instructions to install Maven 3.8.6 can be found on the Maven website\n   - Instructions to install Java 8 or 11 can be found on the Oracle website or by using a package manager like `sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk`\n\n3. Building Flink from source:\n   - Clone the Flink repository: `git clone https://github.com/apache/flink.git`\n   - Navigate to the Flink directory: `cd flink`\n   - Build Flink using Maven: `./mvnw clean package -DskipTests`\n   - Building Flink may take up to 10 minutes\n   - Flink will be installed in the `build-target` directory\n\n4. Developing Flink:\n   - Committers recommend using IntelliJ IDEA for developing the Flink codebase\n   - Minimum requirements for an IDE include support for Java and Scala, as well as Maven with Java and Scala\n   - IntelliJ IDEA can be downloaded from: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\n   - IntelliJ IDEA Scala Plugin can be installed from: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347\n\n5. Additional information:\n   - IntelliJ IDEA supports Maven out of the box and offers a plugin for Scala development\n   - Instructions for configuring IntelliJ IDEA for Flink development can be found in the \"Setting up IntelliJ\" guide provided on the webpage\n\n6. Support:\n   - Developers and community members can be contacted via mailing lists for help\n   - Bugs found in Flink can be reported by opening an issue on the Flink GitHub repository\n\nOverall, the webpage provides detailed instructions for building Apache Flink from the source code on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system."
