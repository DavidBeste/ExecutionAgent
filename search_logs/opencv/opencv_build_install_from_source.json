        "analysis": "The webpage provides detailed instructions for building OpenCV from source on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system. Here is a structured list of steps and requirements to install or build the project 'opencv':\n\n1. Uninstall Current OpenCV Installation:\n   - Remove existing OpenCV installation using the command: sudo apt purge libopencv-dev libopencv-python libopencv-samples libopencv*\n\n2. Install Dependencies:\n   - Execute the command: sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libdc1394-22-dev python3-pip python3-numpy\n\n3. Install GStreamer Support (Optional):\n   - If GStreamer support is needed, run: sudo apt install gstreamer1.0* ubuntu-restricted-extras libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev\n\n4. Install CUDA Support (Optional):\n   - Ensure CUDA is installed on your system following NVIDIA's CUDA Installation Guide for Linux or using NVIDIA SDK Manager for Jetson.\n\n5. Clone the OpenCV Project:\n   - Clone either RidgeRun's fork or the original project using specific git clone commands provided on the webpage.\n\n6. Clone the Contrib Extra Modules:\n   - If non-free modules are desired, clone the project using the given git clone commands.\n\n7. Configure the OpenCV Project:\n   - Create build directory, change to it, and run cmake command with specific configurations provided on the webpage.\n\n8. Add Extra Modules, GStreamer, or CUDA Support (Optional):\n   - Append additional configurations for extra modules, GStreamer, or CUDA support if needed as described on the webpage.\n\n9. Build the OpenCV Project:\n   - Start the build process using the command: make -j8\n\n10. Install the OpenCV Project:\n    - Install the built project with: sudo make install\n    - Update the shared library cache with: sudo ldconfig\n\n11. Troubleshooting:\n    - Follow troubleshooting steps provided on the webpage for issues with Eigen/core or running out of space on Jetson boards.\n\nThe webpage provides a comprehensive guide with detailed instructions for building OpenCV from source on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system."

        "analysis": "To install or build the project 'opencv' on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system from source code, the following steps need to be followed:\n\n1. Install minimal prerequisites (Ubuntu 18.04 as reference):\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cmake g++ wget unzip\n```\n\n2. Download and unpack sources:\n```bash\nwget -O opencv.zip https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.x.zip\nunzip opencv.zip\n```\n\n3. Create build directory:\n```bash\nmkdir -p build && cd build\n```\n\n4. Configure using cmake:\n```bash\ncmake ../opencv-4.x\n```\n\n5. Build the project:\n```bash\ncmake --build .\n```\n\n6. If you want to build with opencv_contrib, follow these additional steps:\n```bash\n# Install minimal prerequisites (Ubuntu 18.04 as reference)\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cmake g++ wget unzip\n\n# Download and unpack opencv_contrib sources\nwget -O opencv_contrib.zip https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/archive/4.x.zip\nunzip opencv_contrib.zip\n\n# Create build directory and switch into it\nmkdir -p build && cd build\n\n# Configure with opencv_contrib\ncmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../opencv_contrib-4.x/modules ../opencv-4.x\n\n# Build\ncmake --build .\n```\n\nPlease note that the web page provides detailed instructions on installing the compiler and build tools, downloading sources, configuring and building, checking build results, and installing the project."
