Ensure that Node.js is installed: Express 4.x requires Node.js 0.10 or higher. Express 5.x requires Node.js 18 or higher.\n\n2. Create a directory for the application and make it the working directory:\n```bash\n$ mkdir myapp\n$ cd myapp\n```\n\n3. Use npm to create a package.json file for the application:\n```bash\n$ npm init\n```\nFollow the prompts and set the entry point to app.js.\n\n4. Install Express in the myapp directory:\n```bash\n$ npm install express\n```\nTo install Express temporarily without adding it to the dependencies list:\n```bash\n$ npm install express --no-save\n```\n\n5. Once Express is installed, you can add modules in the dependencies list by running:\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nIf the webpage does not provide information on building Express from source code, it is recommended to check the official Express documentation or Node.js documentation for detailed installation instructions."
