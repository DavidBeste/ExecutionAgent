        "analysis": "In the provided webpage, the instructions for installing and setting up the Activiti Extension project on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system from source code are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the steps outlined for Java Development Kit (JDK) and Apache Maven installation, the following structured list of steps can be derived to set up the project on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system:\n\n1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8:\n- Check if JDK is already installed by running the command: `javac -version`\n- If not installed, download JDK from the Oracle JDK site and follow installation instructions.\n- Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable by editing the `.bashrc` file and adding: `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk`.\n- Verify JDK installation by running: `javac -version` and `java -version`.\n\n2. Install Apache Maven 3.2.5 or above:\n- Check for existing Maven installation by running: `mvn --version`.\n- If not installed or below 3.2.5, download Maven from the Apache Maven project website.\n- Install Maven following platform-specific installation instructions.\n- Set the MAVEN_OPTS and M2_HOME environment variables by editing the `.bashrc` file.\n- Verify Maven installation by running: `mvn --version`.\n\n3. Create the Activiti Extension Project:\n- Create a directory for the project, e.g., `activiti-extension-jar`.\n- Create a Maven `pom.xml` file with specified content and dependencies.\n- Customize the properties, dependencies, and build settings in the `pom.xml` file as needed based on the project requirements.\n\nFollowing these steps should help in setting up and building the Activiti Extension project on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system."
