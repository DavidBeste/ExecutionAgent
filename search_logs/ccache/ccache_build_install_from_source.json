Optional: Asciidoctor to build the HTML documentation.\n7. Optional: Python to debug and run the performance test suite.\n\nSoftware Library Dependencies:\n- BLAKE3\n- cpp-httplib\n- doctest (optional, disable with -D ENABLE_TESTING=OFF)\n- fmt\n- hiredis (optional, disable with -D REDIS_STORAGE_BACKEND=OFF)\n- span-lite\n- tl-expected\n- xxhash\n- Zstandard\n\nInstallation Steps:\n1. Create a build directory: ```mkdir build```\n2. Change to the build directory: ```cd build```\n3. Run CMake configuration: ```cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..```\n4. Build the project: ```make```\n5. Install the project: ```make install```\n\nAdditional options during installation:\n- Set installation directory to /usr: add ```-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr``` to the CMake command.\n- Set system configuration file directory to /etc: add ```-D CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR=/etc``` to the CMake command.\n\nUsing ccache for compilation:\n- Prefix your compilation command with ccache.\n- Let ccache masquerade as the compiler: create symbolic links to ccache for specific compilers (e.g. gcc, g++).\n\nNote: For more details and specific configurations, refer to the project's GitHub page."
