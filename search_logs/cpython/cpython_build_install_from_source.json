Here is a structured list of steps and requirements to install or build the project 'cpython' on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system:\n\n1. **Install Git**:\n   - CPython is developed using Git for version control.\n   - Git command line program is named git.\n   - Install Git using the command: `sudo apt install git`\n\n2. **Get the source code**:\n   - Fork the Python repository on GitHub.\n   - Create a local clone of your personal fork.\n   - Configure the remotes.\n   - Execute the following steps:\n     ```\n     $ git clone git@github.com:<username>/cpython.git\n     $ cd cpython\n     $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/python/cpython\n     $ git config --local branch.main.remote upstream\n     $ git remote set-url --push upstream git@github.com:<your-username>/cpython.git\n     $ git remote -v\n     ```\n\n3. **Install pre-commit**:\n   - Run the following command to install pre-commit as a Git hook:\n     ```\n     $ pre-commit install --allow-missing-config\n     ```\n\n4. **Compilation and Building**:\n   - Configure CPython with pydebug flag:\n     ```\n     $ ./configure --with-pydebug\n     ```\n   - Compile CPython:\n     ```\n     $ make -s -j2\n     ```\n   - To build with optimizations, use:\n     ```\n     $ ./configure --enable-optimizations --with-lto\n     ```\n\n5. **Additional Dependencies**:\n   - Some extension modules may require additional development headers.\n   - Install additional libraries as needed based on your work.\n\n6. **Running the Interpreter**:\n   - After building, run the interpreter from the working directory.\n   - No need to install the built copy of Python.\n\n7. **Clang**:\n   - If using clang, set necessary flags like `-Wno-unused-value -Wno-empty-body -Qunused-arguments`.\n\n8. **Optimization**:\n   - Enable optimizations during the configuration process if needed.\n\n9. **Windows**:\n   - Git for Windows may be needed for Windows environments.\n   - Use Microsoft Visual Studio for building on Windows.\n   - Ensure necessary Python development workload is selected during Visual Studio installation.\n\nUnfortunately, the instructions do not specifically mention requirements for a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system, but the provided steps should be applicable."
