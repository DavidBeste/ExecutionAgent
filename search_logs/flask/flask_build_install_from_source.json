Ensure that Python 3.8 or newer is installed on your system.\n2. Install the necessary dependencies: Werkzeug, Jinja, MarkupSafe, ItsDangerous, Click, and Blinker.\n3. Optionally install python-dotenv and Watchdog for additional functionality.\n4. Ensure that greenlet>=1.0 is installed for gevent or eventlet usage.\n5. Set up a virtual environment for managing dependencies using the venv module.\n6. Activate the virtual environment.\n7. Use the following command to install Flask within the activated environment:\n   $ pip install Flask\n\nPlease refer to the official Flask documentation for more detailed information on building and installing Flask from source code on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system."

Here are the steps and requirements for installing the Flask project:\n\n1. Download the Flask source code from this link: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/F/Flask/Flask-0.10.1.tar.gz\n2. Extract the Flask source code.\n3. Look for a file named setup.py in the extracted Flask folder to find the dependencies.\n4. Download the required dependencies from the following links:\n   - Werkzeug>=0.7: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/W/Werkzeug/Werkzeug-0.10.4.tar.gz\n   - Jinja2>=2.4: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/J/Jinja2/Jinja2-2.7.3.tar.gz\n   - itsdangerous>=0.21: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/i/itsdangerous/itsdangerous-0.24.tar.gz\n   - MarkupSafe==0.23: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/M/MarkupSafe/MarkupSafe-0.23.tar.gz\n5. Install each dependency by running `python setup.py install` for every module.\n6. Install Flask by running `python setup.py install` in the Flask source code folder.\n\nAdditionally, if you are using a Debian-based system, you can also install Flask using APT:\n- For Python 3.x: `sudo apt-get install python3-flask`\n- For Python 2.x: `sudo apt-get install python-flask`"
