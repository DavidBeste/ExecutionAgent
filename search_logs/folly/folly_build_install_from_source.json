Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/facebook/folly\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   cd folly\n   sudo ./build/fbcode_builder/getdeps.py install-system-deps --recursive\n   ```\n\n3. Build the project using getdeps.py:\n   ```bash\n   python3 ./build/fbcode_builder/getdeps.py --allow-system-packages build\n   ```\n\n4. Run tests:\n   ```bash\n   cd folly\n   python3 ./build/fbcode_builder/getdeps.py --allow-system-packages test build.sh\n   ```\n\n5. Additional information regarding finding dependencies in non-default locations, building with CMake directly, and platform-specific instructions are also provided on the webpage.\n\nPlease note that the above steps assume you have the necessary build tools (such as CMake, Python 3.6+, etc.) already installed on your system."

        "analysis": "The webpage does provide information on installing the project 'folly' on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system from source code.\n\nSteps to install 'folly' on Ubuntu:\n1. Clone the 'folly' repository from GitHub and navigate to the build directory.\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/facebook/folly && cd folly/build\n   ```\n2. Run the cmake command with necessary flags according to your system configuration.\n   ```bash\n   cmake \\\n     -DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON \\\n     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \\\n     -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 \\\n     -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED=ON \\\n     -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..\n   ```\n3. Build the project using the make command.\n   ```bash\n   make all\n   ```\n4. Install the built 'folly' library to /usr/local.\n   ```bash\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\nCommands to install 'folly' dependencies on Ubuntu:\n1. Install 'libfolly-dev' from the official repository.\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install -y libfolly-dev\n   ```\n\nIt's also mentioned that if you're using a non-standard compiler or certain libraries that 'folly' requires are not in your path, you may need to provide those in the cmake command as well for successful building."
