Download the libevent source code from the following link:\n   https://github.com/libevent/libevent/releases/download/release-2.1.12-stable/libevent-2.1.12-stable.tar.gz\n\n2. Verify the MD5 sum of the downloaded file:\n   MD5 sum: b5333f021f880fe76490d8a799cd79f4\n\n3. Install the required dependencies:\n   - Doxygen-1.12.0 (Optional, for API documentation)\n\n4. Fix an issue that prevents event_rpcgen.py from working:\n   sed -i 's/python/&3/' event_rpcgen.py\n\n5. Configure and build libevent using the following commands:\n   ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-static\n   make\n\n6. Optionally, if you have installed Doxygen-1.12.0 and wish to build API documentation:\n   doxygen Doxyfile\n\n7. To test the results, run:\n   make verify\n\n8. Install libevent as the root user:\n   make install\n\n9. If API documentation was built, install it with the following commands as root:\n   install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/libevent-2.1.12/api\n   cp -v -R doxygen/html/* /usr/share/doc/libevent-2.1.12/api\n\nNote: Some tests related to regress_ssl.c, regress_http.c, and regress_dns.c may fail due to incompatibilities with OpenSSL-3 or insufficient test timeouts.\n\nContents Installed:\n- Programs: event_rpcgen.py\n- Libraries: libevent_core.so, libevent_extra.so, libevent_openssl.so, libevent_pthreads.so, libevent.so\n- Directories: /usr/include/event2, /usr/share/doc/libevent-2.1.12/api\n\nPlease ensure that you have the necessary permissions to install software as the root user on your system."
