Here is a structured list of steps and requirements:\n\nRequirements:\n1. Python 3.9.x or newer\n2. Python development headers (install python3 and python3-dev on Debian/Ubuntu)\n3. C compiler compliant with the C99 standard\n4. C++ compiler compliant with the C++17 standard\n5. Optional: FORTRAN 77 compiler for numpy.f2py tests\n6. Linear Algebra libraries (optional but recommended)\n7. Cython\n\nSteps to Build NumPy from Source:\n1. Clone the NumPy repository following the instructions in Contributing to NumPy.\n2. Install NumPy from a local copy of the source code using: pip install .\n3. For an in-place build, run:\n   - pip install -r build_requirements.txt\n   - pip install -e . --no-build-isolation\n4. For advanced building with Meson, refer to the instructions provided in the webpage.\n5. Test the build by installing additional dependencies with: python -m pip install -r test_requirements.txt\n6. Run the full test suite with: cd .. # avoid picking up the source tree pytest --pyargs numpy\n\nThe webpage does not provide specific commands to install the required software on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system, as it assumes the user is already familiar with the installation process on these systems."

        "analysis": "The webpage provides instructions relevant to building NumPy from source on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system. Here are the structured list of steps/requirements and commands that need to be installed:\n\nPrerequisites:\n1. Python 2.7.x, 3.4.x or newer\n2. On Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu): `python`, `python-dev` (or `python3-dev`)\n3. Make sure that the Python package `distutils` is installed\n\nCompilers:\n1. C compiler is needed to build any extension modules for Python\n2. FORTRAN 77 compiler is needed for various NumPy modules\n3. Recommended to use GCC 4.x compilers\n\nLinear Algebra libraries:\n1. NumPy does not require any external linear algebra libraries to be installed\n2. It can detect and use available LAPACK library setups like ATLAS, MKL, etc.\n\nCython:\n1. A recent version of Cython is needed for building development versions of NumPy\n\nBasic Installation:\n1. To install NumPy run: `python setup.py install`\n2. To perform an in-place build run: `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`\n\nParallel builds:\n1. From NumPy 1.10.0 onward, parallel builds are possible\n2. Example for parallel install: `python setup.py build -j 4 install --prefix $HOME/.local`\n\nFORTRAN ABI mismatch:\n1. Avoid mixing libraries built with different FORTRAN compilers like g77 and gfortran\n\nChoosing the FORTRAN compiler:\n1. To build with gfortran: `python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95`\n\nDisabling accelerated libraries:\n1. ATLAS and other accelerated libraries in NumPy can be disabled by setting variables: `BLAS=None`, `LAPACK=None`, `ATLAS=None`\n\nBuilding with ATLAS support:\n1. For Ubuntu, install the necessary optimized ATLAS package with: `sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev`\n\nThe webpage does provide detailed instructions and requirements for building NumPy from source on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system."

        "analysis": "The webpage does provide instructions on how to build and install NumPy from source code on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system. Here is a structured list of steps and requirements:\n\n1. Prerequisites:\n   - Python 3.10.x or newer\n   - Python development headers (python3 and python3-dev on Debian/Ubuntu)\n   - Cython >= 3.0.6\n   - pytest (optional)\n   - Hypothesis 5.3.0 or later (optional)\n\n2. Basic Installation:\n   a. If cloning the NumPy git repository, initialize git submodules:\n      ```\n      git submodule update --init\n      ```\n\n   b. To install NumPy, run:\n      ```\n      pip install .\n      ```\n\n   c. For development purposes, run the following commands:\n      ```\n      spin build  # installs in-tree under `build-install/`\n      spin ipython  # drop into an interpreter where `import numpy` picks up the local build\n      ```\n\n   d. Alternatively, use an editable install with:\n      ```\n      pip install -e . --no-build-isolation\n      ```\n\n3. Choosing compilers: \n   - NumPy needs C and C++ compilers, and for development versions also needs Cython. A Fortran compiler isn't needed to build NumPy itself.\n\n4. Build issues: \n   - If you run into build issues and need help, the NumPy and SciPy mailing list is the best place to ask. \n\n5. Installation of BLAS libraries on Ubuntu/Debian:\n   - For best performance, a development package providing BLAS and CBLAS should be installed. Options include libblas-dev, libatlas-base-dev, and libopenblas-base.\n\nThese are the instructions relevant to building and installing NumPy on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system from the provided source code."
