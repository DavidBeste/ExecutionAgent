        "analysis": "The webpage does provide instructions on building the project 'freertos-kernel' with CMake on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system from source code.\n\nHere is a structured list of steps and requirements:\n\nPrerequisites:\n1. Ensure your host machine meets the following prerequisites:\n   - Compilation toolchain that supports the machine's operating system.\n   - CMake version 3.13 or higher installed.\n   - Compatible native build system (GNU Make or Ninja).\n\nSteps to build FreeRTOS with CMake:\n1. Install CMake:\n   - Download the binary distribution of CMake from cmake.org.\n   - Add the CMake executable to the PATH environment variable.\n   - Alternatively, install CMake using a package manager like homebrew on macOS or scoop/chocolatey on Windows.\n\n2. Choose a native build system:\n   - Install GNU Make or Ninja using package managers on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n   - For Windows, you can install standalone Make from Equation or MinGW.\n\n3. Generate build files with CMake:\n   - Run CMake to generate build files for a native build system.\n   - Use CMake command-line tool with options like -DVENDOR, -DCOMPILER, -S, -B to specify the board, compiler, source code location, and build directory.\n   - Add the compiler to the PATH variable or specify its location.\n   - Use options like -G Ninja or -G \"MinGW Makefiles\" on Windows to specify the native build system.\n\n4. Building with a native build system:\n   - Navigate to the output binaries directory.\n   - Use the build system command (e.g., make) to build FreeRTOS.\n   - Example commands: \n     ```bash\n     cd <build_dir>\n     make -j4\n     ```\n\n5. Building with CMake:\n   - Use the CMake command-line tool's build mode to build FreeRTOS.\n   - Use options like --parallel for CPU cores and --target to build specific targets.\n   - Example commands:\n     ```bash\n     cmake --build build_dir\n     cmake --build build_dir --parallel 8\n     cmake --build build_dir --target afr_kernel\n     ```\n\nNote: The webpage does not provide specific commands for installing dependencies on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system."

Clone the repository including submodules by running the following git command:\n   ```\n   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS ./FreeRTOS\n   ```\n\n2. Navigate to the FreeRTOS directory.\n\n3. Execute the `make` command to build the executable.\n\nAdditional Information:\n- The demo provided is a simulator demo, which means it does not run on actual hardware.\n- The provided repository contains the FreeRTOS Linux port and a simple demo.\n- Building instructions can be found in the `README.txt` file in the repository.\n- The demo includes a simple example code for blinking an LED.\n- The recommended tools for building the project are Eclipse IDE with GCC as the compiler.\n- Atmel Studio has been superseded by Microchip Studio, but Microchip no longer supports either for Linux."
