        "analysis": "The webpage does provide relevant instructions for building and deploying a Nest project on a production server. Here is a structured list of steps and requirements:\n\n1. Create a production build of your application using npm run start:prod, which will generate a dist folder within your application source.\n2. Copy the dist folder to your server.\n3. Copy your package.json file into the dist folder on the server.\n4. Run npm install from within the dist folder to install all the node_modules dependencies.\n5. If you are using pm2 to run your node applications, run pm2 start main.js from within the dist folder for deployment.\n6. Optionally, you can use PM2 as a process manager for NodeJS applications in production by creating an ecosystem.config.json file.\n7. Set up a deployment script that includes steps to pull the repository, install dependencies, build the project, and start the production server.\n\nCommands that may need to be installed on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system:\n- npm (Node Package Manager) for managing Node.js packages and scripts\n- pm2 (Process Manager for Node.js applications) for running Node apps in production and managing application processes\n- git (Version Control System) for cloning repositories and managing source code\n\nPlease note that these instructions assume a basic knowledge of Node.js, npm, and deployment practices."

Configure NEST with cmake (may need additional options):\n   - cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<nest_install_dir> </path/to/NEST/src/>\n\n6. Compile and install NEST:\n   - make\n   - make install\n   - make installcheck\n\n7. Source the provided shell script to set environment variables:\n   - source <nest_install_dir>/bin/nest_vars.sh\n\nPlease note that the webpage does not provide the complete list of packages required for building documentation or running NEST server. Consult the environment.yml file for the full list."
