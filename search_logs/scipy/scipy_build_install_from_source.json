Download the source code for SciPy from the official website or repository.\n2. Extract the downloaded source code files to a directory on your system.\n3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the source code files are located.\n4. Install the required dependencies for building SciPy from source. (For Debian/Ubuntu, you can use the command: sudo apt-get install python3-dev gfortran libblas-dev liblapack-dev)\n5. Build SciPy from source by running the command: python setup.py build\n6. Install SciPy on your system by running the command: python setup.py install\n\nCommands to install required dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu:\n- sudo apt-get install python3-dev gfortran libblas-dev liblapack-dev\n\nPlease note that building SciPy from source may require additional steps and dependencies, and it is recommended to use binaries if available for your platform."

System-level dependencies:\n    - C, C++, and Fortran compilers (gcc, g++, gfortran)\n    - Python header files (python3-dev or python3-devel)\n    - BLAS and LAPACK libraries (OpenBLAS, ATLAS, or MKL)\n    - pkg-config for dependency detection\n\n2. Commands to install required packages on Debian/Ubuntu Linux:\n    - sudo apt install -y gcc g++ gfortran libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev pkg-config python3-pip python3-dev\n    or\n    - sudo apt build-dep scipy\n\n3. Building SciPy from source:\n    - If you want to only install SciPy from source once and not do any development work, you can use pip:\n        - To build the latest stable release:\n            - pip install scipy --no-binary scipy\n        - To build a development version:\n            - git clone https://github.com/scipy/scipy.git\n            - cd scipy\n            - git submodule update --init\n            - pip install . --no-binary scipy\n\n4. Building SciPy from source for development:\n    - Clone the SciPy repository:\n        - git clone https://github.com/scipy/scipy.git\n        - cd scipy\n        - git submodule update --init\n    - Create a dedicated development environment (virtual environment or conda environment)\n    - Install all needed dependencies\n    - Build SciPy with the dev.py developer interface:\n        - Conda env:\n            - mamba env create -f environment.yml\n            - mamba activate scipy-dev\n        - Virtual env or system Python:\n            - Activate the virtual environment\n            - Install dependencies from PyPI\n            - Build SciPy using dev.py:\n                - python dev.py build\n\nThese are the relevant instructions for installing or building the 'scipy' project on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system from the source code provided on the webpage."
