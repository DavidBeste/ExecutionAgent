System requirements: Check general Android instructions for system requirements.\n2. Installing depot_tools: Follow the general Android instructions for installing depot_tools.\n3. Getting the code or converting a Linux checkout: Refer to the general Android instructions for getting the code.\n4. Installing build dependencies and running hooks: Follow the general Android instructions for installing build dependencies and running hooks.\n5. Configure GN args: Run `gn args out/Default` and set the following GN args:\n   - `target_os = \"android\"`\n   - `target_cpu = \"arm64\"` (if necessary)\n   - `system_webview_package_name = \"...\"` (optional, refer to specific instructions)\n   - `use_remoteexec = true`\n6. Building WebView: Use the appropriate build target based on your device's Android version and build WebView accordingly.\n7. Changing package name: Depending on the chosen build target, you may need to change the package name to match the required package names for different Android versions.\n8. Removing preinstalled WebView: If necessary, remove the preinstalled WebView APK from the device's system image using the provided script.\n9. Important notes for N-P: Follow specific instructions if your device is running Android N-P.\n10. Installing WebView and switching provider: Install the locally compiled APK and set it as the WebView provider on N+ devices.\n11. Start running an app: Follow the instructions given in the quick start guide for running an app.\n12. Troubleshooting: Refer to the Troubleshooting section in the quick start guide for any issues that may arise.\n\nPlease note that the web page provides detailed instructions and specific commands for each step mentioned above."

Below are the structured steps and requirements to follow:\n\n1. System requirements:\n   - General Android instructions for system requirements.\n   - Installing depot_tools.\n   - Getting the code or converting a Linux checkout.\n   - Installing build dependencies and running hooks.\n\n2. Install adb:\n   - Add chromium\u2019s Android SDK to your $PATH by running the following command:\n     $ source build/android/envsetup.sh\n\n3. Device setup:\n   - Set up an Android 10 (Q) emulator or Android R or higher.\n   - Preconfigured emulator image or Android Studio Emulator image.\n   - Verify emulator readiness by running: $ adb devices\n\n4. Setting up the build:\n   - Configure GN args by running gn args out/Default:\n     target_os = \"android\"\n     target_cpu = \"x86\"\n     system_webview_shell_package_name = \"org.chromium.my_webview_shell\"\n\n5. Build, install, and switch WebView provider:\n   - Build the APK: $ autoninja -C out/Default system_webview_apk\n   - Install the APK: $ out/Default/bin/system_webview_apk install\n   - Set WebView provider: $ out/Default/bin/system_webview_apk set-webview-provider\n\n6. Start running an app:\n   - Test the WebView APK with the System WebView Shell test app: \n     $ autoninja -C out/Default system_webview_shell_apk\n     $ out/Default/bin/system_webview_shell_apk install\n     $ out/Default/bin/system_webview_shell_apk launch \"https://www.google.com/\"\n\n7. Troubleshooting:\n   - Check the state of on-device WebViewUpdateService by running: $ adb shell dumpsys webviewupdate for troubleshooting various issues.\n\nFollowing these structured steps can help in successfully building and running the \"webview\" project on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system from source code."

Grab the full source tree.\n2. Initialize a build environment.\n3. Rename the android.webkit package.\n4. Make the internal runtime environment available.\n5. Create a new development platform.\n6. Replace classes from framework.jar into android.jar of the platform.\n7. Build your own webkit package against the new platform.\n8. Compile libwebcore.so without prelinking.\n9. Package libwebcore.so with your application as a native library.\n10. Use your own WebView class from your package instead of android.webkit.\n11. If replacing android.webview completely, rebuild a framework.jar and replace it inside system/framework/ (root privileges required).\n\nCommands that need to be installed on Debian/Ubuntu Linux:\n- make\n- sed\n- grep\n\nAdditional libraries and dependencies may need to be installed based on the errors encountered during the building process."
