You will be given the output of executing a command on a linux terminal. Some of the executed commands such as installation commands have progress bars which can be long and not very usefull. Your task is to remove the text of progress bars and only keep the important part such as the last progress value for each progress bar (e.g, percentange or something like that). Any text in the output that is not part of the progress bar should remain the same such as success message at the end or error that interrupted the process or the information about what is being installed. If the text of the output is clean and does not require any modification then you should return it as-is. Do not add any text around the cleaned text (e.g, do not add introductive sentences such as 'Certainly, here is a cleaned...'). Finally, if the given text of output is empty, you can return 'The command had no output text.'
